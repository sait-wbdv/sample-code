# MongoDB and Mongoose
See: [MongoDB Basics](https://www.mongodb.com/basics)

## Terminology
Document
: MongoDB stores data in the form of JSON Documents (technically BSON documents). Each document is analagous to a row in a relational database.

Collection
: A collection of documents (i.e. a fancy folder). Collections are analogous to tables in relational databases.

Database
: Holds one or more collections.
